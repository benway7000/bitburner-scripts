How many employees do you have in your tobacco divisions cities?
Artemaesia81

10/09/2023 9:56 AM
All cities open, 9 employees. Just started it.

pretty sure mines still just step-by-step old guide with exporting added
DarkTechnomancer

10/09/2023 9:57 AM
Okay. Keep most of them on 9 for now, but upgrade one city (Sector-12, probably) to like 30-60 employees.
That city is your development city
It's where you'll actually make the products.

10/09/2023 9:57 AM
Oh wow, ok

there are a few t of funds just minutes away 
a single agri round and you  can easily get tobacco going
DarkTechnomancer

10/09/2023 9:58 AM
Once you've got that set up, distribute your employees roughly like this in the big city:
6% operations
30% engineer
8% business
56% management
Artemaesia81

10/09/2023 9:58 AM
Should Sector-12 be that way for all divsions?
DarkTechnomancer

10/09/2023 9:58 AM
In the other cities, put them all on research.
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 9:58 AM
ok
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 9:58 AM
Just for products.
And it's more efficient to focus heavily on a single product division.
We generally go with Tobacco because it's cheap and has extremely good scaling.
So you can get it going fast, and it continues to be good well into the late game.
Anyway, once you've got all your employees assigned, develop a product in the main city, putting like 1e(9-10) or so into the investment fields.
(A good metric is to use around 1% of your funds)

they have ~70b
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:02 AM
Close enough to 100b to still do 1e9
imo
Caldwell
 — 
10/09/2023 10:02 AM
but then just take the first offer of 700b
like holy there is money on the street
and it doesnt matter if the products hit on third or first
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:03 AM
Haha, yeah, but if they can get three tobacco products up without having to spend that, it'll be even better.
Caldwell
 — 
10/09/2023 10:03 AM
three not really good products?
that will each take maybe an hour to develope
instead of a tobacco with ~700b-1t funds invested into? 
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:04 AM
They've been at it for a week, I don't think they're going to mind taking it slow for the moment.
But sure, if you're in a hurry, go ahead and take the 700b, it will help a lot.
Caldwell
 — 
10/09/2023 10:04 AM
but its slow for no gain
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 10:04 AM
I really don't want to screw up and start over. Slow is ok.
Caldwell
 — 
10/09/2023 10:05 AM
you aint screwing up xD
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:05 AM
Well, as someone's mentioned earlier, the bar for first investment is around 300b, and you're way past that.
Caldwell
 — 
10/09/2023 10:05 AM
usually we take that at 300-500b
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:05 AM
A "perfect" start gets 500b.
Artemaesia81

DarkTechnomancer

10/09/2023 10:06 AM
It's fast if you've got a good scripted solution that's already optimized.
It's slow as molasses if you're trying to learn it.

DarkTechnomancer

Yeah, no worries. I'm on your side, here. Corp is painfully slow unless you already know what you're doing.
Which is some serious "draw the rest of the owl" shit.
Artemaesia81

HAHAHA
Some say use scripts. Others complain they don't do enough.
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:08 AM
So once the product is in development you're going to want to focus on upgrading employee stats, advertising, and increasing the size of the office.
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 10:08 AM
So I've been doin all this solo. No scripts, no guides. Losing my mind
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:09 AM
Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast rule on which to do, but a general priority metric would be:
1) Wilsons if you can afford it
2) Adverts or more employees, whichever is cheaper, until you don't have enough money for either
3) Employee stat upgrades

DarkTechnomancer

Crank those out constantly while the product develops, then develop another one until you've got all 3 slots filled.
Artemaesia81

10/09/2023 10:11 AM
I want to make sure I understand everyone. Go for investment($738bn). Use most of that money to invest in a new tobacco product. Use the rest for employees and upgrades?
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:12 AM
No, only use like 1e9 in each investment field.
The vast majority of that money should go into wilsons analytics and adverts in tobacco
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 10:12 AM
Ok that's what I did with my first product.
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:12 AM
And the rest for employees and upgrades.
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 10:12 AM
Oh
And storage?
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:13 AM
You won't need more than base storage in each city for tobacco for a while.
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 10:13 AM
Yeah, it does move on its own.
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:13 AM
Products scale with price rather than production.
So you'll be selling the same small numbers for way higher amounts.
Once you've got three tobacco products developed and price-adjusted, you can look for investors again and aim for a number in the trillions.
Eventually, you're going to want to buy TA2 so that it can handle those prices for you, but just bear in mind that the first time you do that it will cause a serious dip in the quality of new products while research points catch up.
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 10:16 AM
Good to know
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:17 AM
OH! And two things I almost forgot:
1) After the first product develops, go into the support cities (the small ones with all research) and move an employee each into operations and business.
2) Since you're doing this manually, make sure roughly 1/9 employees + 1 are interns.
So for 60 employees, you want 7-8 (I can never remember how to round it) interns, and then the rest following the distribution I gave before.
That's just a tax you gotta pay if you're not scripting tea/parties.
That said, scripting tea and parties is very simple, and also doesn't automatically cost 1TB RAM anymore:

const corp = ns.corporation;
for (const division of corp.getCorporation().divisions) {
    for (const city of corp.getDivision(division).cities) {
        const office = corp.getOffice(division, city);
        if (office.avgEnergy < 98) { corp.buyTea(division, city); }
        if (office.avgMorale < 98) { corp.throwParty(division, city, 5e5); }
    }
}

That will cover all your energy/morale needs for the modest price of 71.6 GB

I just bought the upgrade that removes the tea and party buttons.
DarkTechnomancer
 — 
10/09/2023 10:24 AM
That works too, I suppose, but it's per-division.
Artemaesia81
 — 
10/09/2023 10:24 AM
Yeah, also slow. I'm glad I came here. Thanks

DarkTechnomancer

Might be worth doing some other stuff to get money in the meantime, even nerfed.
I paid for my corporation RAM by batching, but that's probably not a viable option for most people.






============================================================
(IPROD+IINV/10)(-1)

The goto Export String
IPROD -> expected Consumption of that Material in the importing City
IINV  -> existing Stock of that Material in the importing City /10 since we work with per second values

We reduce the negative IPROD Value with the current Stock and then turn it with the(-1) into a positive number to get a functional Export

============================================================
my general advice is to not buy upgrades that cost more than your per second income unless there's a good reason

============================================================
so 3 exports per city name
agri city -> chem city
agri city -> tobacco city
chem city -> agri city
all tobacoos should produce and sell
only the first is focused on developing
============================================================

Let me double-check my round 2 strategy. Been a while since I did it.
Looks like I do 6 employees everywhere for agri/chem, and fill ~2000 warehouse space per city for chemical production boosters.
Though also, I always have to disclaimer this: I don't buy smart supply in my scripts, which saves me a lot. My round 2 budget is closer to 500b than 300b.
Basically, the main goal in round 2 to is get your agriculture quality up to its max potential. 
============================================================
If you can, writing your own smart supply can significantly increase your round one gains
From 300b to roughly 500b

My method is to anchor everything to a specific division (in this case Tobacco) and scale everything else according to its needs. If effective rating is lower than actual rating, then I'll scale up agriculture to make sure production and quality are meeting demand. I'm still working on an efficient way to scale tobacco directly, but a quick and dirty priority system to script would be:
1) Wilson's Analytics anytime its cost is less than 10x your income/s
2) Whichever is cheaper between adverts or a +3 office size in the main tobacco city, if you can afford it
3) The cheapest employee stat upgrade you can afford

@grdsc I figured out a method that's both much simpler and more accurate by source-diving.

The key is that the sold quantity is a very complicated function made of all these multiplicative factors, but none of them are based on the sell price, so we can treat them as (essentially) constants. (They do change, some slightly over time, others in response to things like buying adverts, but for our purpose they're constants.)

This means the entire sell function can be reduced to this: sellQty = C / (sellPrice - MP)^2. Furthermore, if we make sellprice a function of MP (as we usually do), so sellPrice = MP * k, then sellQty = C / (MP * k - MP)^2 = C / (MP * (k - 1))^2 = C2 / (k - 1)^2, i.e. we can absorb MP into the constant as well. Finally, write everything in terms of x = k - 1, and you have a very simple formula to deal with: sellQty = C2 / x^2.

This means you can directly calculate the value to use, based on the previous x and the sold amount, by assuming the constant has stayed the same. (This is the best assumption you can make, given all the hidden variables.) prevSold = C / oldX^2, desired = C / newX^2, so C = prevSold * oldX^2, desired = prevSold * oldX^2 / newX^2, (newX/oldX)^2 = prevSold / desired, newX/oldX = sqrt(prevSold / desired).

So the basis of the method is to adjust x at each step by multiplying with sqrt(prevSold / desired). I tested this in a dev corp, the math works out. I'll outline the full algorithm below.

    Initialize x from the last product's x, as a good initial guess.
    For each step:
    If prevSold was the entire stock, multiply x by an arbitrary constant. 10 is probably a good choice for fast convergence, if this product hasn't found an in-range value yet. Otherwise, you might want to multiply by something more conservative, like 2.
    Otherwise, use the formula sqrt(prevSold / desired) to find the multiplier to apply to x. desired is currentQty - buffer, where buffer is some buffer amount to stabilize the algorithm (maybe 10% of what is regularly produced).
    If the multiplier is too low, cap it at something like 1/3 to keep from catastrophically reducing the price.
    Calculate k = x + 1, and set the new price to MP * k

Oh, there's also the matter of the very first product. Something like 1e-9 is probably a good initial guess (it's faster to converge to a higher multiplier than a lower one.)
Everything I've said is in terms of products, but this works for materials too
