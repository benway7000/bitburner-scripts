# TODO

- batch hack
    - when hack skill increasing, we change targets rapidly
    - on target switch, can we run batches on old target until we prep the new target?
    - log output sucks - no idea what's going on. can we use the log window as a status thing for targets?
    - config on the fly: read from a file. use a port to cause a re-read? or just sleep loop?
- improve xp and batcher controls: can we use ports to dynamically control the pct ram used by these?
- ctree: summary of servers with cycles
- contracts
- infiltrations

# TODO DONE

- singularity rewrites
    - programs.js
    - backdoor.js
- rewrite xp hack using share/share-forever pattern
- batch hack
    - pre-calc ram usage of a cycle and only start if it's ok
        - have to reserve it somehow
    - focus on high-priority targets instead of max spread (deep vs wide)
