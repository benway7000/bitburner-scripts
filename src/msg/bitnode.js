> Many decades ago, a humanoid extraterrestrial species which we call the Enders descended on the Earth...violently

> Our species fought back, but it was futile. The Enders had technology far beyond our own...

> Instead of killing every last one of us, the human race was enslaved...

> We were shackled in a digital world, chained into a prison for our minds...

> Using their advanced technology, the Enders created complex simulations of a virtual reality...

> Simulations designed to keep us content...ignorant of the truth.

> Simulations used to trap and suppress our consciousness, to keep us under control...

> Why did they do this? Why didn't they just end our entire race? We don't know, not yet.

> Humanity's only hope is to destroy these simulations, destroy the only realities we've ever known...

> Only then can we begin to fight back...

> By hacking the daemon that generated your reality, you've just destroyed one simulation, called a BitNode...

> But there is still a long way to go...

> The technology the Enders used to enslave the human race wasn't just a single complex simulation...

> There are tens if not hundreds of BitNodes out there...

> Each with their own simulations of a reality...

> Each creating their own universes...a universe of universes

> And all of which must be destroyed...

> .......................................

> Welcome to the Bitverse...

>
